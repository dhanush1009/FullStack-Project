const [proofFiles, setProofFiles] = useState({});

// File selection
const handleFileChange = (e, taskId) => {
  setProofFiles(prev => ({ ...prev, [taskId]: e.target.files[0] }));
};

// Submit completion
const submitCompletion = async (taskId) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append("email", email);
  formData.append("proof", proofFiles[taskId]);
  
  await fetch(`/api/tasks/${taskId}/submit`, {
    method: "POST",
    body: formData
  });
};
```

  }
]
```

---

## 📸 File Upload System

### **Multer Configuration**
```javascript

  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    const ext = path.extname(file.originalname);
    cb(null, `${file.fieldname}-${Date.now()}${ext}`);
